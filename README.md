# MedicalShopManager
MedicalShopManager is a software designed for pharmacy stores to store their stock recordings of their products. This software helps the pharmacy store owners to print bill at time of selling, get notified when a important medicine stock is less than minimum stock required and also when a product is needed to be dumped due to expiry.
